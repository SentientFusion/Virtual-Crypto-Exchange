# VERY IMPORTANT: Ignore a file where you might store your API key
# Do NOT hardcode API keys in your code. Store them in a separate file (e.g., api_key.txt)
# and list that file here to prevent it from being committed.
# Based on binance_client.py, you have API keys directly in the code.
# It's highly recommended to move them to a separate file and ignore it here.
# Example if you move keys to a file named secrets.py or config.py:
# secrets.py
# config.py

# PySpark and other potential generated files/dirs
spark-events/
.ipynb_checkpoints/

# Database file (if it's generated or contains user-specific data you don't want in Git)
# Based on your CryptoSim overview, you have crypto_sim.db. If this is generated, you might ignore it.
# crypto_sim.db
